https://www.pantrify.us/ is a meal planning, recipe collection web app.

The goal for this app is to allow users to create and save recipes to their personal profiles.  Allowing for editing, deletion of the recipes.  The app will also allow the user to plan his or her meals using the calendar provided.

The user will also have access to a shopping list that can be generated by selecting 'add to shopping list' in the desired recipe.  This shopping list can be then used to keep track of what the user has bought by sending those items to the pantry.

The pantry will hold items that were bought by the user and it is used by the calendar component to verify if the user has enough ingredients to cook a planned meal.

The calendar will display the recipe name in green if all ingredients are in pantry or red in case there are missing ingredients for said recipe.

Once a day at 10:00am the app will send users that have registered with a phone number, a text message with a reminder of what they chose to cook that day.  If the user does not have a meal planned for that day he or she will not receive a reminder.
